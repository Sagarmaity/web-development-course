                             PARAGRAPH TAG AND PRE TAG
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

HTML Paragraphs:
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>

</body>
</html>

OUTPUT:
This is a paragraph.

This is a paragraph.

This is a paragraph.

HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

The HTML <pre> Element:

The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

 Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

</body>
</html>

Output:
The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
